# Umbrella Web

![](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android/blob/master/howtouse.gif?raw=true)

Umbrella is a web application developed by [Security First](https://www.secfirst.org) that provides human rights defenders with the information on what to do in any given security situation and the tools to do it. It allows the user to choose what they want to do, such as: protect data; securely make a call/email; securely access the internet; plan secure travel; protect their office/home; conduct counter-surveillance; or deal with kidnapping, arrest or evacuation. Once a situation is chosen, the app outlines what to do and what tools to use given your circumstances. This is followed by a simple checklist of recommended actions that can be customised, saved and shared securely. Umbrella’s dashboard also provides users with an up-to-the-minute account of potential risks in their chosen location.

## Example Usage

Umbrella is designed for everyone (people looking to increase their security, folks living in high risk areas, regular travellers, business people, techies, journalists, NGO staff, aid workers, human rights defenders, social workers, environmental activists etc).

However, when we built Umbrella we tried to keep in mind the story of Glen Greenwald and Edward Snowden. Greenwald couldn't communicate with Snowden at the start because he found it cumbersome to setup encryption (he nearly missed one of the biggest stories of the decade because of this!). Also, when he (and Laura Poitras) travelled to Hong Kong - they didn't have much knowledge about how to meet securely with Snowden and detect surveillance. This is common problem for journalists and activists. Umbrella is designed to solve this problem (and others) by having nearly everything they would have needed to know in the one place - in their pocket.

## Main Parts of Umbrella

**Introduction:**
This is the part the user sees first. It explains briefly how the app works and the basic terms and conditions.

**Menu:** The menu is the main way for a user to navigate. It lists the dashboard, lessons and tool guides.

**My Security:**
This where you access checklists you have favourited in "My Checklists" and real time updates in "The Dashboard"

**Lessons:**
Lessons are where users can learn about topics and things that they can do to improve their security. Some of the lessons have different levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert) depending on the your needs, ability and risk. Each lesson is broken down into sections. At the end of each lesson is a list for other resources and further reading.

**Checklists:**
Checklists are quick and easy references to help users implement the advice in the lessons. You can tick them off as you complete each item. Items can be added, disabled deleted and edited. If you favourite them by clicking the star, you will then see them in "My Checklists." Checklists can also be shared in through other apps such as your email.

**Forms:**
Forms allow a user to quickly fill out and share important information about issues such as their travel plan in a high risk location or report on a digital/physical security incident.

**Dashboard:**
The dashboard contains security customFeeds from places like the UN Relief Web and the US Centers for Disease Control. You enter your location (and how often you want to be updated). Every a new update is released (e.g a disease outbreak in your location), the information comes up on the dashboard.

**Tool Guides:**
These are detailed guides about how to use software and apps mentioned in the lessons.

## Lessons

The general flow of lessons are presented in order to replicate the typical way that a user works.

## Glossary

Contains explanations of the various terms used in the app.

## About

Explains the licences that we use for and by Umbrella. Also says a big THANKYOU to everyone who's work we built on to make it happen.

## Dashboard Feed Sources

![](https://github.com/rorymbyrne/Umbrella_android/blob/master/DASHBOARDLOGOS.png?raw=true)

These are the sources that we currently include for real-time updated security customFeeds. For privacy reasons, users never connect directly to these services. We are always looking for more useful sources that will help users keep updated on the move.

- [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov): updates on disease and health warnings
- [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org): updates on natural disaster issues such as floods, earthquakes and tsunamis
- [UN / ReliefWeb](http://reliefweb.int): excellent physical security updates that amalgamate information from the UN and various NGOs - though not available in every country
- [US State Department](https://www.state.gov/travel/): updates mainly focused on the security situation for travellers and internationals - available for every country

## Settings

The three vertical dots in the top of the app. Here you can:

- Set a password
- Change the refresh interval for the security customFeeds
- Change your location
- Change your feed sources

## Requirements

Any browser on any device!

**Contributing Ideas**

Idea’s are powerful things! If you have any about what we could do

at <info@secfirst.org>.

## Contributing Code

We have a really big development plan of functionality we want to
include in the future and are currently in the process of building a way
to manage contributions from the open source community. Until we have
that up please drop us a mail to <info@secfirst.org> if you are
interested in a contributing a specific part of future code. If there is
something you want to help out with in the interim, then here is some
basic advice.

1.  Fork it!
2.  Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
3.  Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'
4.  Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
5.  Submit a pull request :D

**Build Instructions**

Setup environment file based upon the README.env environment file and use the following commands to start your local server:

```
npm install
npm install forever -g
npm run dev // runs development server with nodemon listening for server changes
// export all environment variables here in command line before building, for production instances
npm run build // builds the next js app
npm run start // to run production on local
forever start -a -o out.log -e err.log server.js // for production instances
```

If you'd like to use a different branch for Umbrella content, in your terminal change directory to `/static/assets/content` (root dir for content git) and run `git checkout YOUR_BRANCH`. You will also need to change the branch in the repo fetch in `/server/api/github`.
